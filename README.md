# Football Manager Blog Website

A responsive blog website dedicated to Football Manager content, designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This website serves as a platform for Football Manager enthusiasts to access tactics, guides, wonderkid lists, and other content related to the popular football management simulation game. The site features a modern, responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Modern grid-based design for content organization
- Interactive elements powered by JavaScript
- Newsletter subscription forms
- Article sharing capabilities
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Fade-in animations for a dynamic feel

## Files Structure

- `index.html` - The homepage with featured and latest articles
- `article.html` - A sample detailed article page
- `styles.css` - All the styling for the website
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality for interactive elements

## How to Run

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the website.
2. No server or special setup is required as this is a static website.
3. Click on the "Read More" links to see a sample alert (in a real implementation, these would link to full articles).

## Customization

### Adding New Articles

To add a new article to the homepage:

1. Duplicate an existing article structure in `index.html`
2. Update the content, title, image, and category
3. Link it to a new article page based on the `article.html` template

### Creating New Article Pages

1. Copy the `article.html` file and rename it (e.g., `new-tactic.html`)
2. Update the content sections, including:
   - Article title and meta information
   - Featured image
   - Article content
   - Author information
   - Related articles

### Modifying Styles

The CSS is organized by sections with clear comments. To modify styles:

1. Open `styles.css`
2. Locate the section you want to modify (e.g., header, hero, posts)
3. Update the CSS properties as needed

## Browser Compatibility

This website is designed to work with all modern browsers, including:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Notes

- The website currently uses placeholder images. Replace them with actual Football Manager screenshots or relevant images for a production site.
- The newsletter subscription forms currently only simulate submissions. To make them functional, you would need to connect them to a backend service.
- Social sharing buttons are for demonstration and would need to be connected to actual sharing APIs in a production environment.

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- User accounts and comments system
- Search functionality
- Dark mode toggle
- Tactic downloads
- Video embeds for tactical analysis
